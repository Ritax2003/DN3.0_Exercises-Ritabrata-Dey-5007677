Explore What's New in Spring Boot 3
Spring Boot 3.x introduces several new features and improvements over the previous versions. Here are some of the key updates:

Java 17 Baseline:

Spring Boot 3.x requires Java 17 as the baseline. This means you must use Java 17 or higher when working with Spring Boot 3.x.
Jakarta EE 9+ Support:

Spring Boot 3.x fully embraces the Jakarta EE 9+ namespace changes. For instance, all javax packages have been renamed to jakarta. This change was made as part of the transition from the old Java EE (now Jakarta EE).
Native Image Support:

Spring Boot 3.x offers first-class support for GraalVM native images. This allows you to compile your Spring Boot application to a native executable, resulting in faster startup times and lower memory consumption.
Observability Enhancements:

Spring Boot 3.x integrates with the new Micrometer Observability framework, which includes metrics, logging, and tracing in a unified manner. This improves the ability to monitor and troubleshoot applications.
Improved Kotlin Support:

Spring Boot 3.x has enhanced support for Kotlin, including improvements in function signatures, Kotlin Coroutines, and better overall performance for Kotlin-based projects.
Dependency Upgrades:

Spring Boot 3.x includes upgrades to popular libraries and dependencies:
Spring Framework 6.x
Hibernate ORM 6.x
Apache Tomcat 10.x
Security Enhancements:

Spring Security 6.x is part of Spring Boot 3.x and aligns with the new Jakarta EE namespaces and provides improved OAuth2 support.
Spring AOT (Ahead-of-Time) Compilation:

Spring Boot 3.x enhances AOT compilation support, which is particularly beneficial for native images. This allows you to optimize your applications at compile time rather than at runtime.
